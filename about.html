    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Miklam Homestay is a family-run retreat in Rangrik, near Kaza — a place where tradition, comfort,
      and genuine Himalayan warmth come together. Built in classic Spitian architecture with modern comforts,
      our homestay reflects the serene simplicity of mountain life. Every brick and beam tells a story of local craftsmanship and care.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      At Miklam Homestay, we believe in offering guests more than a stay — we offer a feeling of belonging.
      Our goal is to help travelers experience the true essence of Spiti: its people, food, and peaceful pace of life.
      We encourage slow travel, meaningful conversations, and conscious exploration that respects local culture and nature.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Eco-conscious hospitality — we minimize waste and encourage reuse.</li>
      <li>Home-cooked meals made from fresh, local ingredients.</li>
      <li>Guided insights into Spitian culture and daily life.</li>
      <li>Warm hospitality rooted in family traditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Life at Miklam Homestay</h3>
    <p>
      Wake up to the sight of snow-dusted peaks and the sound of fluttering prayer flags.
      Begin your morning with a steaming cup of butter tea or fresh-brewed coffee.
      Evenings are cozy around the heater, sharing stories with the hosts or fellow travelers.
      The starlit Spiti sky is often the perfect way to end the day — quiet, vast, and unforgettable.
